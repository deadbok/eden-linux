# See the moused man page for available settings.

# Set to your mouse device psm[0-9] for PS/2 ports, ums[0-9] for USB ports
# Leave blank to try to autodetect it
#moused_device="/dev/psm0"

# Any additional arguments required for a specific port
#moused_args_psm0=""
# or for all mice
#moused_args=""

# You can also multiplex the init script for each device like so
#   ln -s moused /etc/init.d/moused.ums0
# This enables you to have a config file per mouse (forces moused_device
# to ums0 in this case) and control each mouse.
# devd can also start and stop these mice, which laptop users will find handy.
