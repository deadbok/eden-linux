# Unless you're a kernel developer or driver writer then this won't
# be of any interest to you at all.
# The following options allow to configure the kernel's core dump
# facilities.

# The dump_device variable is used to specify which device will be
# used by the kernel to write the dump down. This has to be a swap
# partition, and has to be at least big enough to contain the whole
# physical memory (see hw.physmem sysctl(8) variable).
# When the variable is commented out, no core dump will be enabled for
# the kernel.
#dump_device=/dev/ad0s1b

# The dump_dir variable is used to tell savecore(8) utility where
# to save the kernel core dump once it's restored from the dump
# device. If unset, /var/crash will be used, as the default of
# FreeBSD.
#dump_dir=/var/crash

# The dump_compress variable decide whether to compress with
# gzip(1) the dump or leave it of its original size (the size of the
# physical memory present on the system). If set to yes, the -z option
# will be passed to savecore(8) that will proceed on compressing the
# dump.
#dump_compress=NO
