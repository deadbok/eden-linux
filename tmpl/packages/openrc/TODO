- _ifindex is not a reliable means of calculating metrics:
	_ifindex is used for calculating metrics for new devices but has a major
	problem: Since it's only the nth entry in /proc/net/dev
	And devices may be removed from that file, and reordered, you won't always
	get the same result.
	If you do:
	- add eth0 - _ifindex (eth0=0)
	- add vlan1 - _ifindex (eth0=0,vlan1=1)
	- add vlan2 - _ifindex (eth0=0,vlan1=1,vlan2=2)
	- rem vlan1 - _ifindex (eth0=0,vlan2=1)
	- add vlan3 - _ifindex (eth0=0,vlan2=1,vlan3=2)
	Now your routing table has entries for both vlan2 and vlan3 with a metric of 2.
