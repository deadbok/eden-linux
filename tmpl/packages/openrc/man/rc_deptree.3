.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions provide a means of querying the dependencies of OpenRC
services.
.Pp
.Fn rc_deptree_update
updates the service dependency tree, normally
.Pa /lib/rc/init.d/deptree .
.Fn rc_deptree_update_needed
checks to see if the dependency tree needs updated based on the mtime of it
compared to
.Pa /etc/init.d ,
.Pa /etc/conf.d ,
.Pa /usr/local/etc/init.d ,
.Pa /usr/local/etc/conf.d ,
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
and any files specified by a service.
.Pp
.Fn rc_deptree_load
loads the deptree and returns a pointer to it which needs to be freed by
.Fn rc_deptree_free
when done.
.Pp
.Fn rc_deptree_depend ,
.Fn rc_deptree_depends
and
.Fn rc_deptree_order
return a list of services from the
.Fa deptree
based on the
.Fa type
or
.Fa types
of dependency.
.Fa options
can be a bitmask of
.Va RC_DEP_TRACE
and
.Va RC_DEP_STRICT .
.Va RC_DEP_TRACE
follows each services dependencies right down to the first service needed and
.Va RC_DEP_STRICT
only lists services actually needed or in the
.Va runlevel .
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
Each function that returns
.Fr "RC_STRINGLIST *"
should be freed by calling
.Fn rc_stringlist_free
when done.
